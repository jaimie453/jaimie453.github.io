    Usability, accessibility, and performance — these are three key aspects of
    web development that've unfortunately been neglected over the years. With
    extensive experience working on design systems, I've been able to refine my
    skillset to address this gap, and ultimately accomplish a goal I think any
    web developer should have: providing a better experience for all users.
