  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Jaimie Bowen, a {{ currentYear - 1999 }} year old front-end
    developer based out of Lakewood, Ohio. I graduated from Kent State
    University with a major in Computer Science in 2021, and have been working
    full time as a developer since.
  </p>
  <p>
    While I was into programming from a young age, I struggled to find my niche
    until I delved into front-end development. I love that my role allows me to
    work closely with designers to craft a pleasant user experience for
    everyone.
  </p>
  <p>
    I enjoy learning about everything front-end related, but I'm especially
    interested in the following areas:
  </p>
  <ul class="bullet-list bullet-list--2-columns">
    <li>CSS architecture</li>
    <li>Accessibility</li>
    <li>Web performance</li>
    <li>Usability</li>
    <li>Design systems</li>
    <li>Technical writing</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Outside of coding, I usually spend my free time reading, learning languages,
    cycling, or playing video games.
