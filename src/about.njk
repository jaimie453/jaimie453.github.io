    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Jaimie Bowen, a {{ currentYear - 1999 }} year old front-end developer based out of Lakewood, Ohio. I graduated from Kent State University with a major in Computer Science in 2021, and have been working full time since.</p>
    <p>While I was into programming from a young age, I struggled to find my niche until I delved into front-end development. I love that my role allows me to work closely with designers to craft a pleasant user experience for everyone.
<p>I enjoy learning about everything front-end related, but I'm especially interested in the following areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scalable CSS</li>
            <li>Accessibility</li>
            <li>Web performance</li>
            <li>Usability</li>
            <li>Design systems</li>
            <li>Tech writing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Outside of coding, I usually spend my free time reading, learning languages, cycling, or playing video games.</p>
